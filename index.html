                            <h2>User Research</h2>
                            <p>I usually begin my research by creating a script for interviews that I will conduct to better understand what the problem is. Once I've identified the problem(s) I think of solutions and prioritize them. 
                                I then create the potential solutions with Figma and Invision, and test them. With the feedback from the testing I continue the process of iterating. 
                                Some of the other tools that I use for this process are Miro, Google Drive, and Github.

                                <p>My approach to user empathy usually begins with creating an empathy map. I try to understand the user as much as possible by thinking of things that a typical user would say, think, do and feel. By doing this I get a better picture of what the users problems are and how they can be fixed</p>
